    "description": "Lord Shiva’s “birth” is symbolic, not historical. He is revered as the eternal, unborn source of consciousness, appearing in forms like Rudra or Jyotirlinga to guide creation. His presence is celebrated in philosophy, yoga, and devotion rather than tied to a specific earthly year or place."
