    "longdescription": "Sanatanadharmam.in is a small, volunteer-led initiative focused on preserving and sharing spiritual resources. Our contact channels are intended to be practical and approachable. The team handles a range of inquiries from factual corrections to requests for partnership. Because many team members volunteer part-time, we try to be transparent about response expectations and to route messages so that they are handled by the right person.\n\nWhen writing to us, clarity helps. If your message concerns a textual correction, indicate the page and the exact text in question. If you are proposing a translation or an audio recording, include samples or links to your previous work so we can assess fit and quality. For donation-related enquiries, specify whether you need a receipt, documentation for accounting, or partnership details: this helps us provide the appropriate response.\n\nWe take privacy seriously. Contact details provided to us are used only for the stated purpose of responding to your message or for accounting purposes related to donations. We do not share personal contact information with third parties for marketing purposes. If you wish to remain anonymous when reporting an erratum or suggesting a change, state that preference and we will honor it where feasible.\n\nWe also welcome institutional collaborations with libraries, academic departments, and community organizations. Such collaborations typically begin with a short proposal describing shared goals and possible deliverables. We take care to ensure that collaborations respect the intellectual and spiritual traditions involved and do not commercialize sacred materials inappropriately.\n\nIf you need urgent assistance — for example, a time-sensitive media request or an urgent legal/rights question — flag the message as urgent and provide a phone number if you are comfortable with a phone follow-up. In most cases we will respond to urgent media requests within a few days, but complex legal or rights matters may require more time as we consult contributors and advisors.\n\nFinally, we invite feedback on how to improve communication: clearer contact forms, better categorization of requests, or more structured volunteer onboarding. If you have suggestions about improving how we handle messages or projects, please share them. Your input helps the site serve its audience more effectively and respectfully.",
    "acknowledgement": "Thank you for taking the time to contact us. Your engagement helps make the project stronger and more useful for everyone."
